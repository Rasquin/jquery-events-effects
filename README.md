CHALLENGE

Inside your script.js file, add a click event which will trigger 
when a <p> tag is clicked and will change the color of all <p> tags to red.
When a <h2> is hovered over, the background of all <h2>s are changed to the colour lightblue.
When a <h2> is hovered over its font size increases, but only for that particular <h2>
When a button is hovered, the background color of the page turns black.
When a button is no longer hovered, the background color of the page turns grey.


CHALLENGE EFFECTS I
Edit your html file to change all the <a> tags to <button> elements. Donâ€™t forget 
the closing tag and to remove the href attribute. Make the first button hide
when clicked. 
 
On the same button, try the slow, medium, fast, and a number in milliseconds 
(you will need to refresh to get the button back).

CHALLENGE EFFECTS II
Use toggle to alter the buttons behaviour.

When the button is clicked, the paragraph above vanishes.
When the button is clicked again, the paragraph reappears.

CHALLENGE EFFECTS III
Use slideToggle instead of toggle (from the last Challenge) to show or hide the paragraph.

CHALLENGE EFFECTS IV
Use fadeTo in conjunction with mouseenter and mouseleave to modify the button. 
Fade to 50% opacity on mouseenter and fade back to 100% on mouseleave.
